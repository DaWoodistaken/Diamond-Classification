# HW1 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling. The notebook contains detailed steps to process the data, analyze patterns, and build machine learning models to predict target variables effectively.

## Dataset
This dataset contains various attributes of diamonds. It has a total of 53,940 rows and 10 columns. Here is a breakdown of each column and its content:

- `carat`: Represents the carat weight of the diamond (float type). The average carat value is 0.798, ranging from a minimum of 0.2 to a maximum of 5.01.
- `cut`: The quality of the diamond cut. This is a categorical column with values like "Ideal," "Premium," and "Good."
- `color`: The color grade of the diamond, represented by letters (D being the best, J being the lowest).
- `clarity`: The clarity of the diamond, categorized with values like "SI2" and "VS1."
- `depth`: The depth percentage of the diamond, indicating its height relative to its diameter.
- `table`: The width of the diamond's top surface as a percentage, with values ranging from 43 to 95.
- `price`: The price of the diamond, in U.S. dollars.
- `x`: The length of the diamond (in mm).
- `y`: The width of the diamond (in mm).
- `z`: The height of the diamond (in mm).

Some notable statistics:

The price range is quite wide, from a minimum of $326 to a maximum of $18,823.
The "x," "y," and "z" columns contain some records with a minimum value of 0, which may indicate erroneous data.
Depending on the dataset's intended use, further analysis could be conductedâ€”for example, examining which features significantly impact diamond pricing.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types for consistency
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis is performed to identify patterns and correlations within the data. This section includes:
- Statistical summaries
- Data visualizations for key features

## Modeling
Multiple machine learning models are implemented and evaluated, including:
- Model training and tuning
- Performance comparison based on metrics like accuracy and precision

## Results
After comparing models, the best-performing model is selected and discussed.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries if not already installed.
2. Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
